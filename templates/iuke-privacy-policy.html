    <h1>Privacy Policy for iUke</h1>
    <p>Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy covers how we collect use, disclose, transfer and store your information. Please take a moment to get to know our practices and contact us if you have any questions.</p>

    <div class="section">
    <h2>Subject of Data Protection</h2>
    <p>The subject of data protection is personal data. According to Section 3, Subsection 1 of the German Federal Data Protection Act ("Bundesdatenschutzgesetz"), these are individual details on personal or objective circumstances of a certain person or certain persons. These include details such as your name, your postal address, your email address, your telephone number or, where appropriate, even use-data.</p>
    <h2>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h2>
<p>By using iUke, we will collect the following anonymous usage data in order to improve our service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your date and time of access,</li>
        <li>The operation system version you use,</li>
        <li>The device type you use,</li>
        <li>The playback times of each song track.</li>
        <li>Crash reports</li>
    </ul>

<p>These data are stored anonymously and are not assigned to any identifiable person at anytime. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.</p>
<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>You can use the iUke product both with and without registering/login. However, we may not be able to synchronize your preference data and redeemed items among different devices. In order to do this, you will be asked to authorize us to access the existing profile and other information from services like Facebook.</p>
    <p>Those information will be collected from you when you login with your Facebook/Twitter/Google accounts, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, or use certain other site features in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
        <li>To personalize user's experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</li>
        <li>To synchronize information such as the unlocked items among your devices.</li>
        <li>To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.</li>
        <li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.</li>
</ul>

    <p>If you use iUke in combination with a registered account, all data entered will be integrated into a database. The purpose of this database is to allow you to synchronize the data of iUke on different devices at any time. Data are transmitted to the respective terminal using SSL encryption so that your data are transmitted securely.</p>
<p>In the iUke app, you will be able to create audio and/or video recordings. These data are stored only on your device and will not be transferred or accessed by us, unless you actively share them onto social network such as Youtube or SoundCloud.</p>
    <h2>Access Your Entered Data</h2>
    <p>
        If you use an Facebook/Twitter/Google account, we will not be able to make any modification. However, you can change these data by the original login service providers(Facebook/Twitter/Google).
If, in the future, we provide our own login service and you will be able to change your data by then.
You can request to delete your data by emailing us.
    </p>

This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our app and website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. </p>
    <p>However, non-personally identifiable information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
